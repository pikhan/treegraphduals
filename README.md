This package is an extension of my Master's thesis: [The Horizontal Tunnelability Graph is Dual to Level Set Trees](https://scholarworks.unr.edu//handle/11714/10548).
I have tried to keep everything as compatible as possible with other popular time series, tree, and graph libraries. This package serves to allow for the simple computation of
- Level Set Trees of Time Series as Piecewise Linear Excursions
- Level Set Trees and Partial Trees of Arbitrary Time Series
- Level Set Trees of Arbitrary Functions via Sympy
- Harris Paths of Binary Trees (and Partial Trees)
- Duals of Binary Trees (Horizontal Tunnelability Graphs)
- Duals of Binary Trees w/ Partial Trees
- Horizontal Visibility Graphs of Piecewise Linear Excursions
- Horizontal Visibility Graphs of Arbitrary Time Series
- Horizontal Visibility Graphs of Arbitrary Functions
- Horizon Visibility Graphs of Piecewise Linear Excursions
- Horizon Visibility Graphs of Arbitrary Time Series
- Horizon Visibility Graphs of Arbitrary Functions
- Visibility Graphs of Piecewise Linear Excursions
- Visibility Graphs of Arbitrary Time Series
- Visibility Graphs of Arbitrary Functions
- Time Series Merge Trees of Arbitrary Time Series
- Time Series Merge Trees of Arbitrary Functions
- Chiral Merge Trees of Arbitrary Time Series
- Chiral Merge Trees of Arbitrary Functions
- U-shaped Segments of Arbitrary Time Series
- U-shaped Segments of Arbitrary Function
- Mean Degree of a Graph
- Mean Path Length of a Graph
- Clustering Coefficients of a Graph
- Degree Distributions of a Graph
- Degree Sequences of a Graph
- Horton-Strahler Orders of a Binary Tree
- Hurst Exponents
- Horton Pruning of a Tree
- Persistence Diagrams/Barcodes

Our Trees should be assumed to have the option to be both weighted or unweighted. We plan to include the ability to investigate time-varying trees (hence, time-varying duals) with appropriate interpretation on time series.
