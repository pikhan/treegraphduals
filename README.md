This package is an extension of my Master's thesis: [The Horizontal Tunnelability Graph is Dual to Level Set Trees](https://scholarworks.unr.edu//handle/11714/10548).
I have tried to keep everything as compatible as possible with other popular time series, tree, and graph libraries. This package serves to allow for the simple computation of
- Level Set Trees of Time Series as Piecewise Linear Excursions
- Level Set Trees and Partial Trees of Arbitrary Time Series
- Level Set Trees of Arbitrary Functions via Sympy
